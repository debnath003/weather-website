### How It Works
1. The website fetches weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
2. Users select a **city** and a **time** from the dropdown menus.
3. The website sends a request to the **OpenWeatherMap API** for the selected city.
4. The API returns the weather information for that city.
5. The website displays the weather information to the user.
